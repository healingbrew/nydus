// Goal: Write a tool utility file that is capable of converting Blizzard/heroprotocol.ts files without issue.
// Secondary goal: a library that can download .py files for unrecognized replay versions
//
// Since the "protocol" python files only have different metadata (the methods never change), we only need to store those.
// Thus it's easy to automate.
